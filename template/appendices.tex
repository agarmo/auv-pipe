\section{About Appendices}
If you have many appendices, do it like this: A page signifying the start of the appendices saying ``Appendices'', then the appendices numbered A, B, C, \ldots

If you only have one appendix, do not have a page saying ``Appendices''. Have just one unnumbered chapter with title ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix: Name of Appendix''.
