\chapter{Modelling}
	This chapter summarizes the problem and assumtions taken considering the pipeline following problem.
	A controller will be derived used for tracking and maneuvering of the AUV vehicle. A Kalman filter
	will be derived for the smothing and predictions of the pipeline and a guidance algorithm will be
	presented. The behaviour of the system will be treated in the last sections of this chapter, where the
	flow of the descision prosess will be presented.


\section{Problem Outline}
\label{chap2:problem}
	To solve the pipeline following problem it is important to have a clear formulation of the problem.
	This is a path following problem, since the pipeline can be represented as a continous path in
	space. The geometric convergence to the path is the primary objective. There can be dynamical
	constraints along the path, i.e velocity constraints but these are considered secondary to the goal of
	geometric convergence. When there are dynamic constraints the problem is a Trajectory Tracking
	Problem. If only geometric convergence are considered the problem is called a Path Following Problem.
	As stated in the definitions in Chapter~\ref{chap1-guidance-alg}

	In this report the pipeline will be formulated as a two dimentional path. This because the pipeline
	are layed on the sea bottom, and are assumed to follow the bottom signature. Then the path following
	is reduced to a two dimentional problem. The \textit{heave} state can be decoupled and in the
	controller design. The depth controller then needs to keep a constant height above the sea bottom.
	This ignores the posibility of free spanning pipelines.

	In order to limit the problem and ease the implementation, the pipeline are assumed to be a stright or
	nearly strigth, piece-wise continous line segment. The pipeline can only change direction at defined
	places called junctions. The application of this guidance system are only for long, continous streches of
	piplines. 

	An AUV carrying out a pipeline inspection mission is in most cases a low speed assumtion is valid. The
	\textit{HUGIN 1000} AUV are designed for speeds from 0-3 m/s. The inspection speed assumed in the
	rest of the report are around 1 m/s. This are realtively low speed, and the quadratic terms in the
	Coriolis/centripetal or Damping matices can be neglected. 

	\begin{figure}[hbtp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pics/blockdiagram}
		\caption{Block diagram the path following controller}
		\label{fig:ch2-blockdiagram}
	\end{figure}
	As outlined in Figure \ref{fig:ch2-blockdiagram} the building blocks of the pipeline following
	control system are the cruising controller, guidance system and the filter
	which fuses the known data about the pipeline and the measured pipeline data. To recreate the 
	pipeline coordinates in three dimentions the distance to the sea bottom is measured by a sonar. The
	filter uses prior knowledge about the pipeline to-be-followd which can be inaccurate. The filter then
	uses this together with the altitude information and camera output to estimate the position of the
	pipeline. If the pipeline should be lost at any time the filter will try to predict where the pipeline
	are and serve as input to the guidance system.
	
	The system should be able to handle burried sections of the pipeline. The camera will not be able to
	sense the pipeline during the burried strech and other sensors have to be included. A bottom
	penetrating sonar might be used for this purpose, or a magnetic pipe tracker. These sensors are able
	to sense the pipeline even if burried up to 3 meters. \cite{PhD_lecture} This sensors will give the
	AUV better chances to regain track after the burried strech than if it were to relay on just dead
	recogning from the predicted pipeline information alone.

\section{Pipeline representation}
	The representation of the pipeline is important because it is used in the Kalman filter to predict
	where the pipeline is going. The pipeline is parametrized by $\varpi \in \mathbb{R}$ to get a
	continous and smooth pipeline.

	In this report the pipeline are parameterized as:
	\begin{equation}
		P_w(\varpi) = \left [ \begin{array}{c}
					\varpi \\
					k_y \varpi \\
					z(\eta)
				\end{array} \right ] \quad \varpi \in (0, \infty)
	\end{equation}
	where $k_y$ are constant and $z(\eta)$ is some function described by the sea bottom and are assumed
	known. This represents the straight line as the pipeline are assumed to be.
	
	


\section{Kalman filter}
	The Kalman filters purpose is to smooth the camera output and predict forward where the pipeline will
	be in the future to supply a better heading reference for the guidance controller.

	The position of the pipeline are given some uncertanty becuase the pipeline may have moved after it
	was layed or the navigation system of the AUV might be erronous. This gives:
	\begin{equation}
		P_w(\varpi) = \left [ \begin{array}{c}
					\varpi \\
					k_y \varpi \\
					z(\eta)
				\end{array} \right ] + \mathbf{B}\delta
	\end{equation}
	The function $\delta$ are a slowly varying disturbance which can be modeled as a \textit{1st order Markov
	Process}, and $\mathbf{B}$ is some 2x3 matrix.
	\begin{equation}
		\dot{\delta} = -\mathbf{T} \delta +  w
	\end{equation}
	where $w \in \mathbb{R}^2$, are a zero mean unity variance white noise process. This describes the
	error in the position. The matrix $\mathbf{T}$ specifies how the error evolves. Because the error are
	slowly varying the eigenvalus of $\mathbf{T}$ should be chosen large. Time differentianting
	the position estimate with regard to time gives
	\begin{equation}
		\dot{P_w}(\varpi) =  \left [ \begin{array}{c}
						\dot{\varpi} \\
						k_y \dot{\varpi} \\
						\dot{z}(\eta)
					\end{array} \right ] + \dot{\delta}
	\end{equation}
	By setting $\varpi = N(t)$, i.e the North position and completely disregarding the depth coordinate.
	gives the following
	\begin{equation}
		\dot{P_w'} = \left [ \begin{array}{c}
					n \\
					k_y n 
				\end{array} \right ] + \dot{\delta}
	\end{equation}
	Choseing the state vector and input as:
	\begin{equation}
		x = [ P_w'^T \quad \delta^T]^T \quad \Rightarrow  \quad \dot{x} = [\dot{P_w'^T} \quad
		\dot{\delta^T}]^T \quad  u = n
	\end{equation}
	This calls for the following state space representation 
	\begin{equation}
		\dot{x} = \left [ \begin{array}{cc}
					0 & -T \\
					0 & -T
				\end{array} \right] x + \left [ \begin{array}{c}
								1 \\
								k_y\\
								0 \\
								0
								\end{array} \right] u +
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
						\mathbf{0}_{2x2} \\
						\mathbf{I}_{2x2} 
					\end{array} \right] w
	\end{equation}

	The measurement model are more complex. In order to compare the measurement from the camera with the
	state space model, the perspective equations from Section \ref{ch1-cameramodel} are needed. By using
	Equations \eqref{eq:ch1-P_c} and \eqref{eq:ch1-perspective}, we can transform the point from World
	coordinates to image coordinates. We want $y = P_i$
	\begin{equation*}
		y = P_i = \mathbf{H} P_c = \mathbf{H R}^T ( P_w - O(t))
	\end{equation*}
	$O(t)$ is the origin of the camera frame and is equal to the position vector $\eta' = [N(t),
	E(t)]^T$ of the AUV in the NED frame. By including the position vector in the input to the filter and using 
	$P_w = \mathbf{C} x$, the measurement model are conclueded.
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:ch2-measurement}
		y = \mathbf{H R}^T \mathbf{C} x - \mathbf{H R}^T  O(t) = \mathbf{C}'x + \mathbf{D} u
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathbf{C'}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ are apropriate matrices for selecting the right states. $\mathbf{R}$
	are the Rotation Matrix from World coordinates to Camera coordinates. This gives the following model
	for the Kalman filter
	\begin{align}
		x &= \mathbf{A} x + \mathbf{B} u + \mathbf{E} w\\
		y &= \mathbf{C}'x + \mathbf{D} u + v\\
		\mathbf{A} &= \left [ \begin{matrix}
					0 & 0 & -T_1 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & -T_2 \\
					0 & 0 & -T_1 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & -T_2 
					\end{matrix} \right] \quad \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{matrix}
										1 & 0 & 0 \\
										k_y & 0 & 0\\
										0   & 0 & 0 \\
										0 & 0 & 0
										\end{matrix} \right]\\
		\mathbf{E} &= \left [ \begin{matrix}
					0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 \\
					1 & 0 \\
					0 & 1
					\end{matrix} \right] \quad \mathbf{C}' = \left [ \begin{matrix}
						\frac{f}{z_c} \cos{\psi} &\frac{f}{z_c} \sin{\psi} & 0 & 0 \\
						-\frac{f}{z_c} \sin{\psi}& \frac{f}{z_c} \cos{\psi} & 0 & 0 
								\end{matrix} \right] \\
		\mathbf{D} &= \left [ \begin{matrix}
					0 & -\frac{f}{z_c} \cos{\psi} & -\frac{f}{z_c} \sin{\psi} \\
					0 & \frac{f}{z_c} \sin{\psi} & -\frac{f}{z_c} \cos{\psi}
					\end{matrix} \right]
	\end{align}
	$w, v$ are a vectors of unity white noise and have covariance $E(ww^T) = \mathbf{Q}$ and $E(vv^T) =
	\mathbf{W}$. The filter should be run at the same frequency as the guidance system to provide output
	for the guidance system. The prediction will be updated whenever possible, which means when the
	pipeline are visible in the camera after the image processing are done.

	Because of the relatively high frequency of the filter the parameters in the measurement model
	regarding heading and depth, i.e. $\psi$ and $z_c$ can be assumed constant during the sample period.
	This due to the slow dynamics of the AUV, compared to filter rate. This gives a linear model which can
	be guarantead to be optimal for the current case.


\section{Controller Design}
	The model discussed in Section \ref{sec:ch1-model} is used to derive the controller equations for the
	AUV control system.

	The control system which supply the lower-level control system with forces and moments references, is 
	divided into 3 sub systems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Speed control
			\item Depth control
			\item Heading control
		\end{itemize}
	This is called the flightmode controller, which is used for normal pipeline tracking, descent and
	ascent. This type of controller where chosen because it will be more energy efficient than other more
	actuated controllers. The second reason is even if the AUV is almost fully actuated, i.e
	controllable in 5 DOF, the tunnel thrusters which have to be present for this degree of actuation are almost
	usless for higher velocities. This renders just control in 3 DOF, \textit{surge, pitch} and
	\textit{yaw}. This will probably give the most energy efficient pipeline following, because the
	control are based on the cheapest control modes available at the AUV.
	
	The \textit{HUGIN}-type AUV is a slender-body type AUV. This makes it possible to neglect some
	coupling effects between the states in the dynamic model. The \textit{longitudinal} states 
	(\textit{surge, heave, pitch}) can be decoupled from the \textit{lateral} states 
	(\textit{sway, roll, yaw}). This will be utilised in the next sections when deriving the control model
	and controller.

	All coefficient next are defined in accordance with \cite{SNAME}.
	\subsection{Speed Controller}
		The speed controller is derived form the \textit{surge}-subsystem, called \textit{surge}-model
		\cite{fossen}. Under the slow speed assumption, the coriolis/centripetal-matrix is assumed
		zero, $\coriolis \approx 0$  
		\begin{equation}
			(m - X_{\dot{u}})\dot{u} - X_u u - X_{|u|u}|u| u = \tau_1
		\end{equation}
		Setting $\tau_1 = -K_p \tilde{u} - K_i \int \tilde{u} dt - K_d \dot{u}$ the error in the velocity
		reference will go to zeros. The velocity reference is assumed constant and the PID controller
		guarantees that the error will go to zero.
	
	
	
	\subsection{Depth Controller}
		To derive the depth controller in the crusing control system the
		\textit{longitudinal}-subsystem is used as the control model \cite{fossen}. By assuming that the lateral
		states i.e $v, p, r, \phi$, are small, the kinematics can be derived as follows:
		\begin{equation}
			\left [ \begin{matrix}
					\dot{d} \\
					\dot{\theta}
				\end{matrix} \right] = \left [ \begin{matrix}
								\cos{\theta} & 0 \\
								0 & 1
								\end{matrix} \right] 
						\left[ \begin{matrix}
								w \\
								q
							\end{matrix} \right]
						+ \left [ \begin{matrix}
								-\sin{\theta}\\
								0
							\end{matrix} \right] u
		\end{equation}
		The dynamics of the system then becomes
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\left [ \begin{array}{ccc}
					m - X_{\dot{u}} &  X_{\dot{w}} & m z_g - X_{\dot{q}} \\
					X_{\dot{w}} & m - Z_{\dot{w}} & m x_g - Z_{\dot{q}} \\
					m z_g - X_{\dot{q}} & m x_g - Z_{\dot{q}} & I_y - M_{\dot{q}} 
					\end{array} \right]
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
					\dot{u} \\
					\dot{w} \\
					\dot{q} 
					\end{array} \right] \\
				+ \left [ \begin{array}{ccc}
					-X_u	&	-X_w 	&	-X_q \\
					-Z_u	&	-Z_w	&	-Z_q \\
					-M_u	&	-M_w	&	-M_q
					\end{array} \right]
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
					u \\
					w \\
					q 
				\end{array} \right] + 
				\left [ \begin{array}{ccc} 
					0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 &  -(m - X_{\dot{u}}) u \\
					0 & (Z_{\dot{w}} - X_{\dot{u}}) u & m x_g u 
					\end{array} \right]	
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
					u \\
					w \\
					q 
				\end{array} \right] \\
				+  \left [ \begin{array}{c}
					0 \\
					0 \\
					W z_b \sin \theta \\
					\end{array} \right] = \left [ \begin{array}{c}
									\tau_1 \\
									\tau_3 \\
									\tau_5
								      \end{array} \right ]
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		Since the \textit{surge}-speed are stabilized with the controller derived in the previous
		section, the surge equation can be removed from the system under the assumption $u = u_0$.		
		Also by asuming that the \textit{heave}-velocity and $\theta$ are small the control model
		becomes:
		\begin{equation}
			\left [ \begin{matrix}
					\dot{d} \\
					\dot{\theta} \\
					\dot{q} 
				\end{matrix}
				\right ] = \left [ \begin{matrix}
							0 & -u_0 &  0 \\
							0 & 0 &   1 \\
							0 & -\frac{1}{\gamma} W &-\frac{1}{\gamma}M_{w} 
							(m - Z_{\dot{w}})-M_w Z_q
						\end{matrix} \right ] 
				\left [ \begin{matrix}
						d \\
						\theta \\
						q
					\end{matrix} \right] + \left [ \begin{matrix}
										0 \\
										0 \\
										\frac{1}{\gamma}
									\end{matrix} \right] \tau_5
		\end{equation}
		where $\gamma = m I_y - m M_{\dot{q}} - I_y Z_{\dot{w}} + Z_{\dot{w}} M_{\dot{q}}$.
		
		When closing the loop the following is proposed PID-like controller
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\tau_5 &= -K_{dp} \tilde{d} + K_{dd}  \theta + K_{dd2} q \\
				\tilde{d} &= d - d_d \quad \dot{\tilde{d}} = -u_0\theta \quad
				\ddot{\tilde{d}} = -u_0q
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		A similiar controller are implemnted in \cite{NDRE-AUV}.
				

	
	\subsection{Heading Controller}
		Using the \textit{lateral}-subsystem representation from \cite{fossen}. Under the assumtions
		that $w, p, q, r, \phi,$ and $\theta$ from the longitudinal subsystem are small, the
		kinematics are reduced to:
		\begin{align}
			\dot{\phi} &= p \\
			\dot{\psi} &= r 
		\end{align}
		The low-speed assumtion is utilized, higher order velocity terms are neglected, and
		constant \textit{surge}-velocity $u = u_0$ are| assumed. This gives the following system:
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\left [ \begin{array}{ccc}
					m - Y_{\dot{v}} & - m z_g - Y_{\dot{p}} & m x_g - Y_{\dot{r}} \\
					-m z_g - Y_{\dot{p}} & I_x - K_{\dot{p}} & I_{zx} - K_{\dot{r}} \\
					m x_g - Y_{\dot{r}} & I_{zg} - K_{\dot{r}} & I_z - N_{\dot{r}} 
					\end{array} \right]
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
					\dot{v} \\
					\dot{p} \\
					\dot{r} 
					\end{array} \right] \\
				+ \left [ \begin{array}{ccc}
					-Y_v	&	-Y_p 	&	-Y_r \\
					-M_v	&	-M_p	&	-M_r \\
					-N_v	&	-N_P	&	-N_r
					\end{array} \right]
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
					v \\
					p \\
					r 
				\end{array} \right] + 
				\left [ \begin{array}{ccc} 
					0 & 0 & (m - X_{\dot{u}})u \\
					0 & 0 &  0 \\
					(X_{\dot{u}} - Y_{\dot{v}}) u & 0 & m x_g u 
					\end{array} \right]	
				\left [ \begin{array}{c}
					v \\
					p \\
					r 
				\end{array} \right] \\
				+  \left [ \begin{array}{c}
					0 \\
					W z_b \sin \phi \\
					0 
					\end{array} \right] = \left [ \begin{array}{c}
									\tau_2 \\
									\tau_4 \\
									\tau_6
								      \end{array} \right ]
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		The \textit{roll}-state can be removed from the equations because of the assumtions of small
		$\dot{p}, p$ and because of the vessel are considered stabel in roll because of
		the offset in the bouyancy point. The \textit{sway}-velocity can assumebly be neglected, 
		the sway subsystem can be removed as well.  This can be seen from the simulations later 
		in the report. 

		The following control model are used to derive the heading controller. The model is really
		the 1st order Nomoto model, and have become famous for it simplicity yet prove to give good
		results. 
		\begin{equation}
			\left [ \begin{matrix}
					\dot{\psi} \\
					\dot{r}
				\end{matrix} \right]  =  \left [ \begin{matrix}
								0 & 1 \\
								0 & \frac{N_r - m x_g u_0}{I_z - N_{\dot{r}}}\\
								\end{matrix} \right] 
							\left [ \begin{matrix}
									\psi \\
									r
								\end{matrix} \right]
							+ \left [ \begin{matrix}
									0\\
									\frac{1}{I_z - N_{\dot{r}}}
								\end{matrix} \right] \tau_6
		\end{equation}

		The following heading controller are proposed:
		\begin{equation}
			\tau_6 = T\dot{r_d} + r_d - K_{hp} \tilde{\psi} - K_{hi} \int \tilde{\psi} dt - K_{hd}
			\dot{\tilde{\psi}}
		\end{equation}
		The terms $T \dot{r_d} + r_d$ are reference feed forward terms which will guarantee perfect
		tracking during course-changing maneuvers according to. This requiers a smooth reference
		signal and care must be taken to calculate it. \cite{fossen} 


\section{Summary of Assumtions}
	A summary of the assumtions are given here:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The pipeline is layed on the sea bottom, which gives the pipeline the same
		height signature as the sea bottom. The guidance problem is then reduced to a
		two-dimentional problem. No free-spanning pipelines are present.
		\item Pitch- and roll angles, are assumed small together with the corresponding pitch- and
		roll rates. In the vicinity of $\pm 10^{\circ}$ and $\pm 0.05 \mathrm{rad/s}$
		\item \textit{sway} and \textit{heave} velocities are small compared to \textit{surge}
		velocity and any cross-coupling terms may be neglected.
		\item The full state are assumed perfectly known, i.e. velocity and acceleration of the AUV.
		\item The exact position of the are known.
	\end{enumerate}
		


\section{Guidance system}
	An autonomous system is by definition a system that will have minimal interaction from humans, it is
	supposed to do things on its own. This is the guidance systems task.
	Figure \ref{fig:ch2-Guidance-block} shows a proposal of a guidance and descision system for 
	the \hugin vehicle.
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pics/guidance}
		\caption{Guidance System Block}
		\label{fig:ch2-Guidance-block}
	\end{figure}

	The AUV guidance system are assumed to have three modes, \textit{searching}, \textit{tracking} and
	\textit{initialize/finalize}. The \textit{initialize/finalize}-mode are the beginning and end of a
	mission and will not be considered in this report. 
	
	The \textit{searching}-mode are when the AUV are looking for the pipeline. When the pipeline are layed
	on the sea floor, the position may be more or less inexact. Both because of sometimes the great 
	distance from the sea level and to the sea bottom, and sometimes because the pipeline have ``sagged'', 
	i.e moved away from the initial position because of movement in the sea bottom caused by sea currents
	and other environmental forces. 

	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/search_flow}
		\caption{Flow diagram of the search procedure in the \textit{searching}-mode}
		\label{fig:ch2-search-flow}
	\end{figure}
	Figure~\ref{fig:ch2-search-flow} shows the searching procedure. It shows the descisions that the
	descion block need to handle. The system distinguishes between the cases if the pipeline have been
	located before, or not. If the pipeline have not been located before, the system generates a initial
	search pattern, which should be designed to cover larger area. If on the other hand the pipeline have
	been located before, and tracking have been initialised, another pattern should be generated. The
	system then follows this search pattern until it gets output from the camera, or other possible
	sensors. Then the position are marked and a turning trajcetory are generated. When the pipeline then
	is reaqcuired the guidance system goes to the tracking mode.
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{pics/contact_trajectory}
		\caption{A turning trajectory for one possible contract}
		\label{fig:ch2-turning-trajectory}
	\end{figure}
	
	When in the \textit{tracking}-mode the AUV tries to follow the pipeline as closly as possible, and
	keep the pipeline inside the field of view as best as possible.

	\subsection{Reference Calculation}
		A look-ahead based guidance algorithm is chosen for it's simplicity and robustness. All
		together a pipeline are made up of mostly linear segments or at least almost linear
		segment. One can then assume that the direction of the pipeline can be known exact.
		No sudden turns are assumed and pipeline junctions are assumed to be non excisitng. This gives
		the following equations, some are treated in Chapter~\ref{chap1-guidance-alg}.
		\begin{align}
			\psi_d &= \alpha_k + \psi_r \\
			\psi_r &= \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{-e}{\Delta} \right)\\
			e &= -(n(t) - p_x)\sin\alpha_k + (e(t) - p_y) \cos\alpha_k
		\end{align}
		
		In the presence of ocean current it will cause the heading to ``lean'' towards the current if
		the look-ahead distance is not chosen too far away. There will be some kind of equalibirium
		between the current and the AUV heading. This will will work well under the assumption that
		the current are constant.
		
	
	\subsection{Search Patterns}
		\label{subsec:ch2_searchpattern}
		It is obvious that some kind of search pattern must be implemented for this kind of
		application. This might be customized for every mission or it might be selected from a library
		of suiting search patterns. 
		This section will look at some search patterns which might be suiting for the pipeline search
		application.

		\begin{figure}[htbp]
			\centering
			\subfigure[Divergent Zig-Zag pattern for lost pipeline during tracking]{
				\label{fig:ch2_zig_zag}
				\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{pics/divergent_zig-zag}} \quad
			\subfigure[Outwards spiral pattern for inital pipeline search]{
				\label{fig:ch2_spiral}
				\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{pics/spiral_search}}
			\caption{Differnet search pattern}
			\label{fig:ch2_searchpattern}
		\end{figure}
		The first case is when the pipeline are not in its predetermined position or the position
		sensors gives out erronous readings, some kind of search need to be initiated to find the
		pipeline. This could be something like the depicted case in Figure~\ref{fig:ch2_spiral}.
		Spiral pattern going outwards to try to find the pipeline in the visinity of the AUV position.
		This should be aided with other sensors for example with a Side Scan Sonar which provides good
		sensor data in the horizontal directions around the AUV. 

		The other case is when the pipeline are lost during tracking. Since the general direction of
		the pipeline are assumed known, the other pattern are a divergent zig-zag pattern around the
		assumed pipeline trajectory, from the last known position.

		The search pattern can be created using polar coordinates from the current position of the
		AUV. The parameters, area in the initial search pattern or the spread angle in the divergent 
		zig-zag should be customised for each mission.

	
\section{Overall System}
	The system flow are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:ch2-flowdiagram}. This is how the overall system behaves
	during a pipeline inspection mission. 
	\begin{figure}[htbp]

		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/Operation}
		\caption{Flow diagram of pipeline inspection mission}
		\label{fig:ch2-flowdiagram}
	\end{figure}
	The system will start by moving to the point where the inspection should start. Then the searching
	procedure will be initiated if the AUV does not make contact with the pipeline imediatly. It will
	search for the pipeline until it has located it and then continue tracking until the the goal are met
	or the onboard energy storage becomes depleted. 

	There are a number of design parameters needed to be set. These parameters might be constant or
	changing between missions. They are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:ch2-design-param}
	\begin{table}[htbp]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{| c | p{6cm} |}
			\hline
			Design Parameter 	& 	Description \\
			\hline
			\hline
			$T_{lp}$ 		&	The Dead recogining time. Time before pipeline are
							considered lost. \\
			\hline
			$\Delta$		&	The lookahead distance, descinding the convergence of
							the heading to the path \\
			\hline
			$\alpha_k$		&	The general pipeline direction, need to be specified\\
			\hline
			$P_w$			& 	The predicted path of the pipeline in world
							coordinates or a prametrization of it \\
			\hline
			$\mathbf{T}$		&	The values of this matrix must be chosen in accordance
							with the uncertainty of the predicted pipeline path.
							Usually chosen large \\
			\hline
			$\mathbf{Q}$ \& $\mathbf{W}$ & 	The covariance matrices of how much you want to trust
							the predicted values of the pipeline and the
							uncertainty of the measured ones. \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Summary of design parameters in the system}
		\label{tab:ch2-design-param}
	\end{table}
	These parameters should be chosen in accorance with what kind of envirionmanetal forces there are in
	the area. Also the search patterns should be customised for every mission. Set how much area they need
	to cover, and vary the spreading angle of the divergent zig-zag pattern in accordance with how certain
	the direction of the pipeline are.
