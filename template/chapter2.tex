\section{AUV model}
	The model used is the one from \cite{fossen}, and is written in the previous chapter, equation \eqref{eq:chp1-model}.
	
	\subsection{Assumptions}
	To simplify the model and implementations of the model. 
		\subsubsection{Low-speed assumption}
		The speed regieme of \textit{HUGIN 1000} is about 1-3 m/s. This is a good idea to check. Run a simulation in simulink with the low speed model and the nonlinear model and compare. Discuss later in the report.

		\subsubsection{Small roll and pitch angles}


\section{Camera modelling}
	
	


\section{Pipeline representation}


\section{Kalman filter}
	The state equations for the filter are the kinematic vector equation, the vector equation relating the motion of a point in the camera field of view to the motion of the AUV and the model of the bias, which represent the model uncertanties and current forces and moments acting on the AUV. The resulting dimention of the state is then $ X \in R^18$
