\section{AUV model}
	The model used is the one from \cite{fossen}, and is written in the previous chapter, equation \eqref{eq:chp1-model}.
	
	\subsection{Assumptions}
	To simplify the model and implementations of the model. 
		\subsubsection{Low-speed assumption}
		The speed regieme of \textit{HUGIN 1000} is about 1-3 m/s. This is a good idea to check. Run a simulation in simulink with the low speed model and the nonlinear model and compare. Discuss later in the report.

		\subsubsection{Small roll and pitch angles}
