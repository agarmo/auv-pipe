\chapter{Introduction}

	The use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) in pipeline following and inspection is of major interrest of oil exploiting enterprises. Today most of the inspection and maintainence of subsea pipelines are done using Remotly Operated Vehicles (ROV). They represent an substantial amount of expences for the oil companies, because of the fact that they are operated by humans. 
	
	An AUV may both improve the data acquisition process and reduce the expences introduced by the inspection procedure. The AUV do not get bored when on lenghty and enduring missions like the ROV operator may become.
