\section{Using the Template}
To use this template, you need memoir. You can find it at CTAN (The Comprehensive \TeX{} Archive Network). 

The memoir manual is very good, both at explaining how to use the memoir class, and general rules of typography. 

%There are several ways of typesetting this example, depending on what changes you have done. If there are no changes in labels or number of pages, run \LaTeX. If there are changes in the labels, but not bibiliography, run \LaTeX{} twice. If there are changes in the bibliography, run \textsc{Bib}\hspace{-.1em}\TeX, then \LaTeX{} twice. If you do not have an .aux file, run \LaTeX, \textsc{Bib}\hspace{-.1em}\TeX, then \LaTeX{} twice again.

%It's usually safest to run \LaTeX{} twice, since then you're assured that the ToC is up to date. 

\section{Not Using the Template}
You do not have to use the template. If you are not using it, use this document as en example of how the final report \emph{can} (but not \emph{must}) look. 

You are also free to modify the template as you see fit.
