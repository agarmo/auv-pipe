\chapter{Preface and Acknowledgements}
	This report is the final report of the fall project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
	This project is to prepear the student for the master thesis the next semester. It is a
	project on how to write a project, so to speak. My opinion is that it is better to do the faults and wrongdoings
	here, than during the master thesis work. This project can be used as a stepping stone and a pre-study of
	the problem to be undertaken in the master thesis.

	For me this project has been a project to get to know all the problems associated with having an 
	Autonomous Vehicle roaming the sea depths. We humans, as sentient beings are perfectly capable 
	of taking the numerous decisions where
	to go and what to do next. An Autonomous Vehicle needs to be programmed, and for every single
	decision it needs to make, there must be some kind of rule. This makes the project huge and it quickly gets 
	out of hand for the designer working with it, and so it did for me, too.

	To create this kind of system, much testing are needed, and a team of engineers to possibly be able cover all
	the aspects associated with a pipeline inspection mission. Kongsberg Maritime has been working on \hugin for
	more than 15 years, and designing an AUV for this kind of application are not done in half a semester
	at NTNU. 
	
	I would like to thank Bjørn Gjelstad and Øystein Engelhardsen at AUV R\&D department, Kongsberg Maritime, for 
	inviting me to the to Kongsberg Maritimes premises at Horten and showing me what the \hugin AUV really looks
	like.
