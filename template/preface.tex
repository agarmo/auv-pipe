\chapter{Preface and Acknowledgments}
	This is the final report of the fall project at the Norwegian Univursity of Science and Technology
	(NTNU). This project are meant to preapere the
	undertaker for the master thesis, which is the last semester in the masters degree at NTNU.
	This is a project on how to write a project. 

	This project is also a pre-project to the masters thesis, an apetizer for the student to continue the
	project and really make it worth the time for the reader or a possible future employer. 
	
	For me this project has been a project to get to know all the problems associated with having an 
	Autonomous Vehicle roaming the sea depths. We as humans, sentient beeings are perfectly capable 
	of taking the numerous descisions where
	to go and what to do next. An Autonomous Vehicle need to be programmed, and for every single
	descision it needs to make, there must be some kind of rule. This makes the project huge and quickly gets 
	out of hand for the designer working with it. 

	To create this kind of system much testing are needed, and a team of engineers to possibly cover all
	the aspects with a pipeline inspection mission. Kongsberg Maritime has been working on the \hugin for
	more than 15 years, and desingning an AUV for this kind of application are not done in half a semester
	at NTNU. 
	
	I like to thank Bjørn Gjelstad and Øystein Engelhardsen at AUV R\&D department, Kongsberg Maritime.
