\chapter{Preface}
	This is the final report of the fall project at NTNU. This project are meant to preapere the
	undertaker for the master thesis, which is the last semester in the masters degree education at NTNU.
	This is a project on how to write a project, and in my opinion have clear signs of this. 

	This project is also a pre-project to the masters thesis, an apetizer for the student to continue the
	project and really make it worth the time of a possible future employer.
