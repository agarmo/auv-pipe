\chapter{Preface and Acknowledgments}
	This is the final report of the fall project at the Norwegian Univursity of Science and Technology
	(NTNU). This project are meant to preapere the
	undertaker for the master thesis, which is the last semester in the masters degree education at NTNU.
	This is a project on how to write a project, and in my opinion have clear signs of this. 

	This project is also a pre-project to the masters thesis, an apetizer for the student to continue the
	project and really make it worth the time of a possible future employer. For me this project has been
	a project to get to know all the problems associated with having an Autonomous Vehicle roaming the sea
	depths. We as humans, sentient beeings are perfectly capable of taking the numerous descisions where
	to go and what to do next. An Autonomous Vehicle need to be programmed, and for every single,
	descision it needs to make, there must be some kind of rule. This is why the project quicklye gets
	huge and out of hand for the designer working with it. 

	
	I like to thank Bjørn Gjelstad and Øystein Engelhardsen at AUV R\&D department, Kongsberg Maritime.
